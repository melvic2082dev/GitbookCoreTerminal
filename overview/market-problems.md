description: Addressing the Growing Demand for AI Models and Computing Resources

# Market problems

The demand for AI models and computing resources is experiencing an unprecedented surge as industries increasingly recognize the transformative potential of artificial intelligence. However, despite this growing demand, there are significant challenges in accessing high-quality AI models and scalable infrastructure that need to be addressed to fully harness the power of AI:

1. **Model Accessibility:** One of the primary challenges lies in the accessibility of AI models. Many high-quality AI models remain underutilized due to the absence of efficient marketplaces that facilitate their exchange. These models, often developed through extensive research and substantial investment, have the potential to drive significant advancements across various sectors. However, the lack of a centralized platform where these models can be easily bought, sold, or traded limits their impact. Researchers and developers frequently struggle to find the right models that meet their specific needs, hindering innovation and slowing progress.
2. **Infrastructure Utilization:** In addition to model accessibility, the utilization of computing resources presents another critical challenge. Organizations often find themselves with surplus computing resources, such as GPU, CPU, storage, and network bandwidth, that go unused. This underutilization represents a missed opportunity, as these resources could be repurposed to support AI initiatives elsewhere. Conversely, many businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), face difficulties in finding affordable and scalable computing solutions. The high cost of AI infrastructure can be prohibitive, limiting the ability of these organizations to implement and benefit from AI technologies.
