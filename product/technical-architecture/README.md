# Technical architecture

The Core Terminal represents a cutting-edge integration of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain technology, designed to leverage the strengths of both to offer innovative solutions across a wide range of industries. The system architecture is built on a modular framework allowing for scalability, robust data security, and decentralized operations to facilitate a secure, transparent, and efficient marketplace for AI infrastructure and models.&#x20;

The architecture is divided into three main layers: the Blockchain Layer, the AI Resource Layer, and the AI Model Layer. Each layer plays a critical role in ensuring the smooth operation of the platform.
