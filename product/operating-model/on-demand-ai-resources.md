# On-Demand AI Resources

To cater to varying needs, The Core Terminal offers flexible rental options for AI resources. Users can access on-demand AI servers on an hourly basis, providing a cost-effective solution for those with sporadic or singular AI processing requirements. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for projects with fluctuating demands, where users may need significant computing power for short periods.

Additionally, the platform provides monthly subscription plans for users needing consistent access to high-tier AI capabilities. These subscription plans are tailored to meet diverse user needs, ensuring that both small-scale projects and large-scale enterprises can find suitable options. By offering both hourly rentals and monthly subscriptions, The Core Terminal caters to a wide range of use cases, from short-term experiments to long-term deployments.

The flexibility of The Core Terminal’s rental options also supports scalability. As users’ needs grow, they can easily scale their access to resources by upgrading their subscription plans or increasing their hourly usage. This scalability ensures that users are not constrained by their initial infrastructure decisions and can adapt their resource allocation as their projects evolve.

Moreover, the platform’s user-friendly interface and comprehensive support services make it easy for users to manage their resources. Users can monitor their usage, track their expenses, and adjust their resource allocation in real-time, ensuring that they maintain control over their AI infrastructure and costs.
