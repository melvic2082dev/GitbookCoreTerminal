# Revenue Sharing and Tokenization

A unique aspect of The Core Terminal's operating model is its innovative revenue-sharing mechanism, facilitated through the staking of its proprietary token, $token. This mechanism incentivizes active participation from stakeholders, encouraging them to contribute resources to the platform. Users who stake $token can earn rewards based on their contribution to the ecosystem’s revenue generation. This tokenized economic model not only promotes engagement but also ensures that the benefits of the platform are distributed equitably among all participants.

The revenue-sharing mechanism is designed to create a virtuous cycle of growth and engagement. As more users stake $token and contribute resources, the platform's capacity and capabilities expand, attracting even more users and resources. This continuous growth cycle enhances the platform’s value proposition, making it an increasingly attractive option for stakeholders.

Additionally, the tokenized economic model provides a transparent and efficient way to distribute rewards. By leveraging smart contracts, the platform can automatically calculate and distribute rewards based on predefined criteria, eliminating the need for manual intervention and reducing the risk of errors. This automation also ensures that rewards are distributed promptly, further incentivizing participation.

Furthermore, the staking mechanism aligns the interests of all stakeholders with the success of the platform. As users stake $token, they are essentially investing in the future growth and development of The Core Terminal. This alignment of interests fosters a sense of community and shared purpose, driving collective efforts towards the platform’s success.
