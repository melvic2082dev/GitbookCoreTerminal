# For Developers

Developers can leverage The Core Terminal to access AI models, computing resources, and a collaborative environment for building and deploying AI solutions. Key use cases include:

* **Access to Pre-defined Models:** Developers can browse and utilize a marketplace of pre-defined AI models to integrate into their applications, saving time and effort in developing models from scratch.
* **Scalable Infrastructure:** By leasing necessary computing resources, developers can scale their AI projects efficiently without the need for substantial upfront investment in hardware.
* **Collaborative Development:** The platform enables developers to collaborate with other AI experts and share models, fostering a community-driven approach to innovation and accelerating the development process.
