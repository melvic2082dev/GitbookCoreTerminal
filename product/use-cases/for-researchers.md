# For Researchers

Researchers can utilize The Core Terminal to disseminate their AI models, gain access to computational resources, and collaborate on cutting-edge projects. Key use cases include:

* **Model Monetization:** Researchers can publish their AI models on the platform, allowing others to purchase or lease them. This not only provides a revenue stream but also enhances the visibility and impact of their work.
* **Data-Intensive Research:** Access to a decentralized pool of computing resources enables researchers to conduct large-scale data analysis and model training, which would be challenging with limited local resources.
* **Academic Collaboration:** The platform supports collaborative research by enabling the sharing of models and data among academic institutions and researchers, promoting interdisciplinary studies and innovation.
