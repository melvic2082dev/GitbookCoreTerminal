# Security and privacy

## Security Measures

1. **Blockchain Technology**:
   * **Immutable Ledger**: All transactions on The Core Terminal are recorded on a decentralized, immutable blockchain ledger, ensuring that records cannot be tampered with or altered retroactively.
   * **Smart Contracts**: Automated and self-executing contracts enforce the terms and conditions agreed upon by parties, reducing the risk of fraud and ensuring compliance without intermediaries.
2. **Encryption**:
   * **Data Encryption**: All data transmitted and stored on The Core Terminal is encrypted using industry-standard encryption protocols. This ensures that sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access and breaches.
   * **End-to-End Encryption**: Communications between users and the platform are secured with end-to-end encryption, ensuring that data remains confidential and secure during transmission.
3. **Authentication and Access Control**:
   * **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Users are required to use MFA to access their accounts, adding an extra layer of security by requiring multiple forms of verification.
   * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Access to sensitive data and functionalities is restricted based on user roles, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access critical information.

## Privacy Protection
