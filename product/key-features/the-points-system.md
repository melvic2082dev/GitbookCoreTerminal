# The points system

The Core Terminal point system incentivizes users who contribute valuable resources such as network bandwidth, GPUs, CPUs, storage, and computing power. Contributors earn points over time, which reflect their active participation and resource provision on the platform. These points serve as a measure of their contribution and can be accumulated through various activities, including continuous resource availability and engagement with the community. All the points will be exchanged to token in the later time.

The feature works as below:

#### 1. User Registration and Login

* **Account Creation**: Users register or log in using a system account with a username and password.
* **Profile Management**: Users have the option to update their email address within their profile settings.

#### 2. Mining Points

* **Mining Activation**: Users start mining by clicking the "Start Mining" button in the Extension.
* **Point Accumulation**: Points are mined over time, calculated in seconds (e.g., 1 point per second).
* **Data Collection**: The system retrieves and saves the user's IP address and location when mining starts.
* **Connection Monitoring**: Mining stops automatically if the user disconnects from the network or closes the web page.

#### 3. Referral Mechanism

**Level-Based Referral System**

* **Referral Levels**: Users can increase their mining rate through a tiered referral system.
  * **10 Referrals**: +5% points per second.
  * **20 Referrals**: +10% points per second.
  * **30 Referrals**: +15% points per second.
* **Example**: If a user receives 1 point per second, with 20 referrals, they receive an additional 0.1 points per second, totaling 1.1 points per second.

**Incremental Referral System**

* **Direct Referral Bonus**: Users receive an additional 1% of the points that his Referee earns.
* **Example**: If a user receives 1.5 point per second and his referee earns 1 points per second, so during the time that his referee is mining, this user will receive an additional 1% of 1 point (i.e., 0.1 point per second), totaling 1.6 points per second.

#### 4. Halving Mechanism

* **Halving Milestones**: The system sets specific milestones for total points mined. Upon reaching these milestones, the reward rate is halved.
* **Example**: If the halving milestone is 100,000 points, once the user's points reaches this milestone, the basic mining rate is halved from 1 point per second to 0.5 points per second.

By implementing these mechanisms, The Core Terminal ensures a dynamic and engaging platform for users, encouraging participation and growth through secure and transparent blockchain technology.
