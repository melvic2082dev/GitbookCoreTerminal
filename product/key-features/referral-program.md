# Referral Program

To encourage user growth and engagement, The Core Terminal has implemented a referral program. Users who refer new members to the platform are rewarded with $tokens, incentivizing them to spread the word about The Core Terminal. This program not only helps expand the user base but also builds a community of engaged and invested stakeholders. The referral program is designed to be simple and rewarding, with clear guidelines and attractive incentives. Users can easily share their referral links with friends, colleagues, and social networks, earning rewards for every new member they bring to the platform. The more users they refer, the greater their rewards, creating a powerful incentive for participation and growth.

The referral program also promotes a sense of community and collaboration among users. By encouraging existing members to invite new users, The Core Terminal fosters a supportive and inclusive environment where everyone benefits from the platform’s success. This collaborative approach helps build a loyal and engaged user base, driving long-term growth and sustainability. The program includes regular updates and promotions to keep users motivated and engaged, ensuring that they continue to actively participate and contribute to the platform’s expansion.
