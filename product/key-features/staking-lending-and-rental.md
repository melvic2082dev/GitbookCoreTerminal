# Staking, Lending, and Rental

**Staking**: At the heart of The Core Terminal’s economic model is its staking mechanism. Users can stake the proprietary $token to earn rewards based on their contributions to the ecosystem. This incentivizes active participation and ensures that stakeholders are engaged in the platform’s growth and success. Staking also aligns the interests of users with the overall health of the platform, promoting a collaborative environment. Users who stake their $tokens not only benefit from potential rewards but also gain voting rights in platform governance, allowing them to influence important decisions and future developments. This democratic approach ensures that the platform evolves in line with the needs and preferences of its community, fostering a sense of ownership and shared responsibility among stakeholders.

**Lending**: The platform addresses the issue of underutilized resources by enabling users to lend their surplus AI infrastructure. Organizations with excess computing power, storage, or bandwidth can list these resources on The Core Terminal, turning idle assets into a steady stream of passive income. This model ensures that valuable resources are not wasted and are instead repurposed to meet the demands of other users. By facilitating resource lending, The Core Terminal helps create a more efficient and sustainable AI ecosystem. Resource lenders can set their own terms and conditions, such as pricing and availability, providing flexibility and control over their assets. This decentralized approach reduces dependency on traditional cloud providers, lowering costs and increasing accessibility for a broader range of users.

**Rental**: To accommodate varying needs, The Core Terminal offers flexible rental options. Users can access AI servers on an hourly basis for short-term projects or subscribe to monthly plans for consistent access to high-tier AI capabilities. This flexibility allows users to scale their resource usage according to their specific requirements, making the platform suitable for both small-scale experiments and large-scale deployments. The rental model is particularly beneficial for startups and smaller enterprises that may not have the financial resources to invest in expensive infrastructure upfront. By offering pay-as-you-go options, The Core Terminal democratizes access to advanced AI technologies, enabling innovation and growth across diverse sectors. The platform also provides detailed usage analytics, helping users monitor their consumption and optimize their resource allocation.
